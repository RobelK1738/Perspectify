# Project: Perspectify

## Overview

Perspectify is a tool designed to make the consumption and understanding of online articles easier and more efficient. The application utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to summarize articles, provide different perspectives on the topic, and detect possible biases. This project is designed to help readers get the most out of their online reading experience by reducing the time and effort required to comprehend complex articles, and by offering a multi-faceted view on the subject matter.

## Features

1. **Article Summarization:** Our tool can condense lengthy articles into shorter versions, retaining key points and insights for quick understanding.

2. **Perspective Analysis:** We provide various possible viewpoints on the article's topic, giving the reader a comprehensive understanding of the subject.

3. **Bias Detection:** The tool can identify potential biases in the articles, promoting critical thinking and balanced perspectives.

## Usage

1. **Web Scraper:** To fetch and extract content from the web, we've implemented a robust web scraper. For detailed usage, check the comments in the `scraper.py` file.

2. **Article Analyzer:** The summarization, perspective analysis, and bias detection are performed by the Article Analyzer. Detailed instructions are provided in the `(Insert Here)` file.
